# YELP LITE

This project takes in a publicly downloaded Yelp dataset and returns a list of recommendations based on a user's review habit. Given a particular userID, it is able to run two queries: the first returns a list of restaurants based on the ratings given by co-reviewers; the second, based on the number of ratings given by co-reviewers.

## Getting Started

Import the project into Eclipse. Next to the Play button, click on Run Configurations. Under Arguments tab, for Program arguments, enter either "yelp_subset_cleaned.csv" (for a subset of the entire dataset, 1,000 rows) or "yelp_all_cleaned.csv" (for the complete dataset, 10,000 rows). Click Run to start the program.

### Prerequisites
